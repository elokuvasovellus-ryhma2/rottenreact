/* 
 * App.css - Component-specific styles for the App component
 * 
 * This file should contain styles that are specific to the App component
 * and its direct children. Use this for:
 * 
 * 1. App component layout and structure
 * 2. Styles for components that are always rendered by App
 * 3. App-specific animations and transitions
 * 4. Styles that don't belong in global (index.css) or other component files
 * 
 * Examples of what to put here:
 * - .app { ... } - Main app container styles
 * - .main-content { ... } - Main content area styles
 * - App-specific animations
 * - Styles for components that are direct children of App
 * 
 * Examples of what NOT to put here:
 * - Global resets (use index.css)
 * - Navbar/Footer styles (use their own CSS files)
 * - Page-specific styles (use feature-specific CSS files)
 * - Utility classes (consider using a separate utilities.css)
